> A way to serve static assets built from multiple components on the fly


## Quick-Start example

run locally: `http://localhost:3001/build/css?components=core,share@0.2.0`

Will download bskyb-core and version 0.2.0 of bskyb-share

The aim is to then serve the resulting css in a compiled state using Sass so that duplicates dependencies are removed.
